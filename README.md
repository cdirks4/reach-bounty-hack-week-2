Program Details:
Letâ€™s start at the very beginning. We are asking you to write a simple swap smart contract.
 
What kind of contract we are asking for: A swap contract between two users where the smart contract knows who the Attacher is. The exchange is done with network tokens.

Participant A tells the contract who participant B is. The address should be stored in a Map or Set. Your contract should then check who the attacher is and only allow the swap if the addresses match.

Your program should include basic console messages that indicate the general status of the contract.

The quantity of tokens swapped is arbitrary, choose any number you like.

Your program should consist of two files index.rsh and index.mjs. You do not need a front-end GUI.
